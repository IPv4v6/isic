You need LIBNET 1.1.x to link ISIC version 0.07 against.

Install:
	./configure
	make
	make install
	make clean	# Optional

Note: It assumes the Libnet library file is installed under /usr/local/lib/.
	Also, please make sure the path to the executable 'libnet-config' is
	added in the environment setting.

It successfully builds and works on:
	FreeBSD 3.1
	Debian Linux 2.1 (Hamm)		<- Named after Toy Story!
	Redhat Linux 7.3
	Redhat Linux 9.0
	Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badge)



What should you use as the sending computer?
	There are pro's and con's to both BSD and Linux.

FreeBSD:  Has an extremely intelligent IP stack.  It assumes that it is more
	intelligent than the programmer.  (It almost always is).  So it will
	clean up some really bad IP Packets.

Linux:	Linux has a brain-dead stack.  So when you send a packet and it is
	totally illegal, it will still send it.  But I have seen linux
	filling the pipe with UDP packets from a raw socket and the linux
	kernel decided to mangle ALL of the UDP checksums.

OpenBSD:  Now you're talking :-)  I can't test it right now because my keyboard
	controller keeps flaking out.  Ratty Intel hardware.
