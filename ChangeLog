ISIC (v0.07)	12/22/2006, by Shu Xiao (sxiao@cisco.com)

	- New IPv6 utilities: isic6, tcpsic6, udpsic6, icmpsic6.
	
	- New tool multisic for sending random multicast UDP packets. 
	
	- Fixed compilation errors with GCC v4.

	- Added -k skip option for esic per the request from some users.

	- Placed the flood control under low traffic limit case only.

		The original flood protection code calls gettimeofday(),
		and runs after sending each packet. This is time consumping
		and prevents the tool from reaching high traffic limit
		on high speed interface (eg. 1000Base-TX). Now the flood
		control will take effect only if the specified maximum rate
		is less than 10MB/s.

	- Corrected -t option bug with tcpsic:
	
		The old one was using it reversely, e.g. -t 30 would generate
		packet with 30% of them having correct TCP checksum. But -t 
		is actually for the percentage of bad TCP checksum. 

	- Changed to used 32-bit random numbers for some fields:
	
		For IPv4 *sic tools, the source/destination IP address and
		TCP sequence/acknowledge numbers are 32-bit width, and
		should be assigned with equal size random numbers. The old
		code did not do shifting correctly.

	- Changed the default value to 10 for all percentage options.
 
	- Cleaned the usage printout of icmpsic:

		There were ports used in the usage printout of icmpsic. This
		was misleading since no ports arguments needed for it.

	- New manual page, try to get more help with "man isic".


ISIC (v0.06)	11/10/2004, by Shu Xiao (sxiao@cisco.com)

	- Changed to link with Libnet 1.1.x:

		With minimum code change to replace old calls to Libnet 1.0.x
		with Libnet 1.1.x functions, and keep Mike's major fuzzing 
		algorithm untouched.
		
		Also found that v0.05 had checksum error with esic, which 
		rooted from bug of Libnet 1.0.x. v0.06 esic works fine with 
		Libnet 1.1.x 

	- More accurate datapush rate calculation: 

		In v0.05 isic, tcpsic, udpsic and icmpsic code, the return
		value of the call to packet sending function was not checked.
		But it actually could fail and return -1, in which case the
		datapush byte count was calculated wrong. v0.06 code skips
		failed cases of data pushing.
 	
	- Fixed esic MAC address printout bug:

		v0.05 esic has a minor problem with MAC address printout.
		The source and destination MAC addresses was actually reversed.
